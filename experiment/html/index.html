  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <p>Thank you for agreeing to participate in our study.  There are two parts to this survey.  This first part will take approximately 35 minutes.  In this part of the study, you will hear lists of 14 words produced by either DeShaun or Connor.  After you hear the word list, you will be given one minute to either recall the list of words (starting with the most recently heard word) OR perform a math task.  Once that minute is over, you will move on to the next list.  You will hear 16 lists in this first part.  Please click continue to hear the first list.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>  <p>Welcome to part 2!
  <p> 
You will see one item at a time presented on your screen, and then you will be required to make one of four responses. 
   <p>
If the item was presented in the previous study phase, and you remember the voice in which it was originally spoken, then you are to chose "DeMarcus-old" or "Conner-old". 
  <p>
If you think the item was presented but do not know the voice, then you are to chose "old".
  <p>
If you do not think the item was presented, then you are to chose "new". 
  <p>
The page  should auto-advance when you chose a response. If it does not auto-advance, click the 'next' button on the bottom right corner.
   <p>

<strong> YOUR JOB: You are to choose a response for each presented word. </strong> </p>
