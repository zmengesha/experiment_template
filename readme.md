# Software installation for Linguist 245 (Spr 2018)

## Install Python 2 & Java

In this course we will not directly program in Python or Java, but some software we use depends on them, so make sure you [have installed Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2714/) (**even if you have installed Python 3, as it is not backward compatible!**).
Type in the terminal `python`. It should open an interactive interpreter and you can see the  version of Python. If it shows Python 3, it might be because you have both versions installed, in which case type in the terminal `python2` instead of `python` (type `exit()` to close the interpreter first).

As for Java, download and install Java Runtime Environment (JRE) from: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

After installation, type in the terminal `java -version` to make sure that everything is working.

## Amazon MTurk Setup

Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is a crowdsourcing platform well suited for running web-based experiments.

1.    Create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account at https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html (create an individual account)
2.    Sign up for an Amazon Mechanical Turk Requester account at the https://requester.mturk.com/.
3.    Now you will link your AWS Account and your MTurk Requester Account. Open https://requester.mturk.com/developer, and click `Link your AWS Account`. Then sign-in with your AWS Root user email address and password.
4. Repeat the above two steps to create and link
 a MTurk sandbox account
 https://requestersandbox.mturk.com/
(This is where you test your experiments)
5. Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and log into your AWS account.
Click on your name and then `My Security Credentials`.
Click on `Get started wih IAM Users`.
Click on `Add User`.
6. Set up a user name and check `programmatic access`, and click `Next:Permissions`
7. Create a new group (e.g., name it `MTurk`), and check `AdministratorAccess` (Under `Policy name`)
8. Review and finish, in the end you should see a created user with an Access key ID and a
Secret access key (click `show`). Save them in a safe place. (**Important: Treat them as any other account numbers and passwords. Do NOT save them in a GitHub repo or anywhere publicly accessible!!!**)

1.    Download and unzip Amazon Mechanical Turk Command Line Tools from https://requester.mturk.com/developer/tools/clt

2.  Now there should be a folder `aws-mturk-clt-...`. Find the `/bin` directory inside this folder and there should be a file called `mturk.properties`. Open this file in a text editor.
3.  There should be lines
```
access_key=[insert your access key here]
secret_key=[insert your secret key here]
```
Paste the keys from the previous step in the place of the placeholders.

4. Save the file. (**Important: This file now contains your secret key, and anyone having this file can post HITs in your name. Do NOT save this in a GitHub repo or anywhere publicly accessible. For maximum security, it might be reasonable to remove the keys once you're done and generate new keys when you do your next experiment.**)

## Git & GitHub

Git is a version-control system and GitHub is a platform to host your projects.

1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). You can read the rest of the linked tutorial to learn more about git.
2. [First time Git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup): The main thing is to configure `user.name` and `user.email`
3. [Sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/)

(For better organization, from now on you may want to create a folder (e.g., `ling245all`) to place all the relevant course material.)

1. Open the terminal and cd into `ling245all`. Execute  
```git clone https://github.com/feste/Submiterator.git
```

2. There should now be a folder `Submiterator`.
Open the `example.config` file inside it, make sure there is a line saying `"liveHIT":"no",`, and then change line  
`"experimentURL":"https://www.stanford.edu/~you/path/to/experiment.html",` into   `"experimentURL":"https://ciyang.github.io/experiment_template",`.  
Save and close the file.

3. Run the following commands:
```
export MTURK_CMD_HOME=PATH_WHERE_YOU_HAVE_UNZIPPED_AWS_CLT/aws-mturk-clt-1.3.4
export JAVA_HOME=PATH_OF_YOUR_JAVA_RUNTIME_ENVIRONMENT
```

The first one tells the Python script where to look for the AWS Command Line Tools, the second one makes sure the Java programs contained in it can be executed (you may find this useful https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t/).

3. Open the command line and navigate into the `Submiterator` directory. Run the following command (or use `python2` explicitly)
```
    python submiterator.py posthit example
```
This will return a message giving the URL to the experiment on MTurk, and generate a bunch of files.
The script stores the HIT's ID in the `example.success` file, so make sure not to delete this one before you have downloaded the results. If you're running an expensive experiment, it might make sense to backup this file.
The name after `posthit` must match the name of the `.config` file that you created previously.

4. It should tell you where the HIT is. Go and work on the HIT in the workersand box. (For the first time, you may need to do some registration.)

4. To get the results:
```
    python submiterator.py getresults example
```

5. To get a list of results by trials, run
```
    python submiterator.py reformat example
```
